1. We need an OpenAi key so got to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) and register there. Then go to [Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/assistants) and click on API Keys option.

2. Also, store your key as an environment variable for easy and secure access: 
>export RAG_OPENAI_KEY="Paste the key you have copied from the Openai dashboard"
