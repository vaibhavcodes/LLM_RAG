## Search can be:- Text Search and Vector/Semantic Search
1. <b> TEXT SEARCH:</b>
 Suppose we have a file containing several Q/A, and based on our query, we need the Answer from that data file.

     * Consider user asked the question=>  I just <span style="color:red">discovered</span> the <span style="color:red">course</span>, can I still <span style="color:red">join</span> it?

     * Here the program will search the exact important keywords (highlighted ones) in the document, and will return the answer to the user.

    <span style="color:green">Limitations:=> </span> If instead of <span style="color:red">join</span>, user writes <span style="color:red">enroll</span>, then in that case our program of text search will fail.
